using UnityEngine;

//DO I EVEN NEED THIS LMAO

//For context: this is used as a List in PlayerStatus (and other places) to identify what item and how many the player has, this is working but maybe there is a better implementation?
public class ItemObject /*: MonoBehaviour*/
{
    public int itemID;
    public int count;
