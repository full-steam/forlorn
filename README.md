    Forlorn was developed as our final thesis project, which title was "Forlorn: English Language Learning Mobile Game Based on the Input Hypothesis and Comprehensible Output Hypothesis". The goal of the project was to aid Indonesian university students in improving their English language skills, specifically for B2-level English. Research methods included studying existing literature, interviews with an expert, and a test conducted before and after playing the game. Based on the tests and surveys to 32 participants in the target age range, there was an increase in B2-level English language ability ranging from a 5% increase to an 89% increase. It was thus concluded that the game was effective in aiding English language learning.
